I developed a 2D game with phases to teach about the initial elements of programming, such as commands, conditionals, functions and loops. Each session offered several phases, starting with guided tutorials to help the player understand the concepts. The subsequent phases presented challenges, in which the user used visual commands to create executable algorithms. The game, with an RPG theme, challenged the player to collect coins, open the treasure chest and face obstacles, such as optimizing paths limited by commands and fighting monsters. This was my first foray into the world of gaming, providing an extremely pleasant experience and resulting in a remarkably interesting final product."
